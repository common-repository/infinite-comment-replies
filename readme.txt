Adds a "Reply" link even for comments at the maximum depth, so you can continue the conversation.
 
== Description ==
 
When WordPress comments reach the maximum allowed nested depth, they no longer show a "Reply" button. So the conversation can't continue, and a commenter has to try and reply to the next higher comment, breaking the comments consistency. Moreover, the person they want to reply to will not be notified.
 
The "Infinite Replies" plugin will correct this. All comments will have a "Reply" link regardless of comment depth. Even if the nested maximum value is reached, people will be able to respond and their comments will appear below the intended target as expected.
 
No more installing third party commenting plugins like Disqus for this basic feature! To see more about how this works, visit
the [official plugin page](https://www.webhostinghero.com/wp-plugins/infinite-comment-replies-plugin-for-wordpress/)
 
== Installation ==
 
1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
 
No additional setup is necessary. The plugin will detect your theme settings automatically.
 
== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= Is there a limit to how long a comment thread can get? =
 
No. It can go on forever if you let it.
 
= Is any additional setup necessary? =
 
No, this is a plug n' play solution. Just install and you're done.
 
= How can I style the Reply button? =
 
Just use CSS targeting the Reply button class "comment-reply-link".
 
== Screenshots ==
 
1. This is what it looks like before "Infinite Replies" is installed. You can see that the "Reply" button is missing at the maximum depth.
 
2. After installation, people can now reply to comments no matter how deep they're nested.
